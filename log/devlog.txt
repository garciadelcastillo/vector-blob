//// SKETCH FOR A 2D VECTOR BASED METABALL ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

GLOBAL PSEUDO
	. STATE
		. a Force element with XY position and radius
		. a falloff function associated to the Force. Could be r / x which is 1 at r, or (r^2 - x^2)^2 which zeroes at r...
		. a Field class, with a grid of FieldPoints elements, containing xy coordinates, uv coordinates and the potential value
		. a IsoCurve class containing lists of points for the curves and draw methods
	. GENERAL CALC PROCESS
		. provided we have a Field, Forces and want to find the points to form isocurves:
		. calculate global potential sum for all FieldPoints
		. find A' and B' points (those who are cardinally neighbours to points over/under the threshold value, usually 1)
		. go over all A' points
			. find their B' neighbors
			. interpolate between potential values to aprox find the xy point with potential == threshold
	. IMPROVEMENTS
		. do the A'-B' interpolation in sorted order to create a curve between them
		. detect different isocurves
		. migrate from node calculation to cell calculation?
